# Automated Name Tag Printer

Automated name tag printing using a Raspberry Pi and DYMO label printer. 

When user checks in to CoWorking Night, OpenHSV sends a request to the Raspberry Pi to print a name tag using the included JSON-encoded information about the user.

The nametag is styled using HTML/CSS templates, allowing quick changes and potential use for other types of events.

Using [Serveo](https://serveo.net/) to expose Pi to internet.
